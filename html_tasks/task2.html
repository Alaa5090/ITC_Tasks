                As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the
                study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
                physics and chemistry The field applies laws of
                different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book
                unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics,
                which will be crucial for the holistic understanding
                of the subject matter.

                This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology
                is an exciting update of an award-winning
                textbook. It explains modem cosmological
                concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the
                Big Bang theory. Its clear, lucid writing style,
                a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it
                exceptionally engaging.

                Planetary research today is a strongly
                multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming
                from engineering and natural sciences. This book
                provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience
                focused overview of solid solar system bodies and
                their evolution, based on the comparative
                description of processes acting on them.

                to provide students with a non-trivial. reasonably
                priced introduction to astronomy. Starting with
                problems astronomers face on Earth connected with
                observation, dre book then moves on to cover the
                Solar System, galaxies and finally cosmology.
